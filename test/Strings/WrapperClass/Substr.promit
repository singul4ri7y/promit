// As you can already guess by the name, 'String.substr(start, end)' returns
// the substring which starts from 'start' index (inclusive) and ends at
// the 'end' index (exclusive). If 'start' or 'end' is provided with positive
// number more than len(string) or negative number less than 0, will be set
// to len(string) or 0 respectively.

take string = "Let's say, take this substring for example";

showl 'Substring starting from -21 to -12 : ${string.substr(-21, -12)}';
