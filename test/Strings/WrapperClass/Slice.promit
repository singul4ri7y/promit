# If you haven't read /test/Strings/WrapperClass/Substr.promit, you
# are requested to do so.

// 'String.slice(start, end, steps)' is completely same as
// 'String.substr(start, end)', except it supports steps.

// It moves 'step' steps forward while constructing the string.

take string = 'This is a string without substring?';

showl string.slice(10, len(string), 2);    // Output : srn ihu usrn?

// WTF? Yeah, I know.
