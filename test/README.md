<h1 align= "center">Welcome to Promit Test Suit</h1>

<p>This test suit serves as group of test files to run against Promit Programming Language. <b>This test suit also will serve as a tutorial to Promit Programming Language.</b> I tried to make it as beginner friendly as possible, so advanced users may get a little bored while reading through all the files. But, I made them quite detailed and delicate about the language features you are gonna face.</p>

<p><b>Note : If you are a beginner who do not know how to code, you are earnestly requested to learn at least any programming language before you proceed. It's Promit Programming Language tutorial, not a programming tutorial. Learning Java, JavaScript or C/C++ is recommended.</b></p>

## Read Order

You are requested to follow this read order in order to get the best experience and learning out of it. All the files and folder are relative to current ``/test``  directory.

<b>If you face ``Examples`` and ``Introduction`` inside of a directory, try reading all the files in ``Introduction`` sub directory first. Then proceed to ``Examples``.</b>

**Go through the ascending order :**
 1. FirstProgram.promit
 2. Prints/all
 3. Variables/all
 4. TakeInput.promit
 5. Operators/all
 6. ControlFlow/all
 7. Switch/all
 8. Loops/all
 9. Language/all
 10. Classes/all
 11. Dictionaries/all 
 12. Properties/all 
 13. WrapperClass.promit
 14. Strings/all
 15. Boolean.promit
 16. Math.promit
 17. Typeof.promit
 18. Inheritance/all
 19. Lists/all
 20. Representation/all
 21. Numbers/all
 22. Functions/all
 23. Files/all
 24. SuperGlobals/all
 25. System/all
 26. Times/all
 27. Benchmarks/all (Not certainly necessary, just for benchmarking stuff)
 28. Algorithms/all (Important! See how Promit really holds up against real life algorithms and problems)
