<h1 align= "center">Welcome to Promit Test Suite üß∏</h1>

<p>This test suite serves as group of test files to run against Promit Programming Language. <b>This test suite also will serve as the introduction and tutorial to Promit Programming Language.</b> Programs are written as beginner friendly as possible, so advanced users may get a little bored while reading through all the files. But, I made them quite detailed and delicate about the language features you are gonna face.</p>

**üì£ Important Note :** If you are a beginner who do not know how to code, you are earnestly requested to learn at least any programming language before you proceed. **It's Promit Programming Language tutorial, not a programming tutorial.** Learning JavaScript, Python or C/C++ is recommended.

## Read Order üìö

You are requested to follow this read order in order to get the best learning curve out of the suite. All the files and folder are relative to current ``/test``  directory.

<b>If you face ``Examples`` and ``Introduction`` inside of a directory, try going through the  ``Introduction`` first. Then proceed to ``Examples``.</b>

**Note:** ``<directory>/all`` means go through all the files in that directory.

**Go through in descending order ‚¨áÔ∏è:**
 1. FirstProgram.promit
 2. Prints/all
 3. Variables/all
 4. TakeInput.promit
 5. Operators/all
 6. ControlFlow/all
