// Use '[index]' on a list variable to get the element of that specific
// index.
// In short 'list[i]' to get a element.

# Note : Using '[index]' is just like using '[prop_expr]'
#        in instances and dictionaries. It also uses the
#        same instruction :).

take list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

showl list[3];    // Output : 4

# Note : List index in promit are 0 base index.

// Getting values out of bound (say using an index of 6 on 5 sized list) will
// trigger an error.

## showl list[5];     Error : List index out of bound.

// But for setting values, any value can be set in any index.
// Even in indices which are out of bound.

# Note : This can also be done in ByteList, though it's not
#        recommended.

list[10] = 'Way out of bound!';

showl list;    // Output : [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, null, null, null, null, null, 'Way out of bound!' ]

# Note : Negative indices are allowed.

showl list[-7];    // Output : 5

// Which is evaluated as :

showl list[len(list) - 7];    // Output : 5
