// 'List.search(predicate, occurance)' searches and returns the first/last
// occurance which satisfies the 'predicate' function.
// Returns the first/last satisfied value. Otherwise null.

// Occurances can be : 
// List::FIRST_OCCURANCE -> Returns the very first occurance of satisfied match.
// List::LAST_OCCURANCE -> Returns the very last occurance of satisfied match.

# Note : Search algorithm is Linear Search.
