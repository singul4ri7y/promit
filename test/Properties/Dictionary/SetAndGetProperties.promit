// The Dictionary section has comprehensive explanation
// on how to define properties within the dictionary.

// This demostration will only focus on how to define
// properties and deal with them outside.

take dict = {};

// This is called property definition, as the property
// 'prop1' didn't exist in the dictionary earlier.

dict.prop1 = 'This is property 1!';

// Get the property.

showl dict.prop1;    // Output : This is property 1!

// Reassign/set the property.

dict.prop1 = Infinity;

showl dict.prop1;    // Output : Infinity
