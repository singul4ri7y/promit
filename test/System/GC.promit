// In simple terms, Garbage Collection serves as an automated memory manager
// which is responsible for release of allocated memories of values (In 
// Promit's case Objects like strings, dictionaries, instances, classes etc.) 
// which is not and will not be used in the future (garbage).

// Generally a certain function is responsible for this garbage collection.
// Promit interpreter calls this function automatically in need, but it also
// can be called manually.

# Use System::gc() to call the garbage collector function.
