// The 'Number.format(lead, trail, fill)' method formats 
// a number to a string in suitable way.

// Note : If you just want to convert a number to string
//        as accurately as possible, use the 'stringify()'
//        method.

// Say, we have a number as such:

take number = 8.883;

// And we want to convert it and print it
// in this way: 888.88 and 008.883000

// That's where the format() method comes into play.

// Note : If the 'fill' parameter is absent, default fill number will be 0.

showl 'The crappy version of $number are ${number.format(3, 2, 8)}, ${number.format(3, 6)}';    // Output : The crappy version of 8.883 are 888.88, 008.883000

showl 'The PI has very big trailing numbers: ${Math::PI}';    // Output : The PI has very big trailing numbers: 3.141592653589793
showl 'We can shorten it to: ${Math::PI.format(1, 4)}';       // Output : We can shorten it to: 3.1415

// Note : If the number is an integer, the 'trail' argument will be ignored.
//        If the number is a floating point number, then the 'lead' argument
//        may be ignored depending on the situation.
