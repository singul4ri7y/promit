// Control flow if-else are same as C/C++
// and C like languages.

take number = 100;

if(number > 0) 
    showl 'The number is positive.';
else if(number == 0) 
    showl 'The number is 0';
else showl 'The number is negative.';

// if() {} else if() {} else {} is broken down to
// if() {} else { if() {} else {} } :)
