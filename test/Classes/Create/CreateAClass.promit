// Create a class with 'class' keyword.

const class Data {
    // 'init' is class constructor.
    // If you are a beginner, then know this constructor
    // is a method/function which is automatically called
    // when the class instantiates.

    init(name, age, passion) {
        // Use 'this' keyword in constructor or any other
        // method to set fields/properties to a class.

        this.name    = name;
        this.age     = age;
        this.passion = passion;
    }

    const query() {
        // 'this' can be used in string interpolation.
        // More about string interpolation in Strings test
        // section.

        showl 'My name is ${this.name}, aged ${this.age}. My passion is ${this.passion}!';
    }
};

// Now instantiate the class.
// Instatiating a class is just like
// calling a function. Only difference is
// you only instantiate a class, where you
// call a function.

// Pro tips : If you are confused whether the 'that_thing'
// you are calling is a function or class, use 'showl typeof that_thing;'
// to verify it. More about it in 'UsefulKeywords' section.

take data = Data('SD Asif Hossein', 19, 'Programming');

showl "Type of 'data' is : ${typeof data}!";

// Call the 'query' method.

data.query();
