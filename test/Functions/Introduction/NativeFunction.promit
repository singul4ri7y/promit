// Well native functions can be a bound method or a regular function.
// In short native functions are functions define natively in 
// Promit's VM (Interpreter).

// 'len' function is used to determine the length of list, string, bytelist
// and dictionary..

// Address can be different due to machine or OS.

showl len;    // Output : <fn native at 0x000000006BB3BAC0>

// Also bound methods can be a native function.

showl List(10).at;    // Output : <fn native at 0x00000000E5BBDBB0 of instance 'List'>
