// Bound Method or in short Method are functions, which stays
// within a class to characterize an object (instance), which
// then can be called from instance.

// Characteristics of a Bound Mehtod : 
// (1) Can use 'this' keyword, which denotes current instance.
// (2) Can only be called from instance.
// (3) Alwyas has instance bounded within it.

const class A {
	any_method(prop) {
		// Characteristic 1.

		this.prop = prop;    // Where 'this' denotes current instance.

		# Note : 'super' denotes super class. Not super instance.

		return prop;
	}
};

// Characteristic 2.

take a = A();

a.any_method('hellow');

// Characteristic 3.

take container = a.any_method;

// Address can be different due to your machine, OS.

showl container;    // Output : <fn 'any_method' at 0x00000000864EA1A0 of instance 'A'>

showl container("From 'container'.");    // Output : From 'container'.

# Note : Static functions are not bound method. They are just regular functions
#        accessible from a class.
