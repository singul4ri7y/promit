## Note: Every single file in Promit is a module. The 'host' module is the module
##       which initally got ran by Promit interpreter. The 'host' can be considered
##       as the root node of the include tree.

// For example this module will be ran by the interpreter directly, so this will be
// a 'host' module. This module may include other modules as well.

## Note: If this module were included, it will not be the host module.
