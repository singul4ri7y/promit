// Use the 'include(path)' global function to include
// a file.

take return_val = include('ThisFileWillBeIncluded');

// Also we could've wrote : include('ThisFileWillBeIncluded.promit')

showl return_val;

// '.' are replaced with '/' :).

// Below code is same as : include('directory.AnotherInclude.promit')
// Which is going to be evaluated as : inlcude('directory/AnotherInclude.promit')

showl include('directory.AnotherInclude');

// Same as : include('directory/YetAnotherInclude/main.promit')

showl include('directory.YetAnotherInclude');

// How 'include(path)' works?
// Let's consider this example.
//     include('themes.default')
// First it will search for 'theme/default.promit' 
// relative to current working directory. If the file
// does not exist, then it will search for an alternate
// path 'theme/default/main.promit'.

// Note : If we had used include('theme.default.promit')
//        or include('theme/default.promit') then it
//        would have just searched for 'theme/default.promit'
//        without any alternate path or whatsoever.
