// You can specify a root directory where Promit can start looking 
// files to include using the a System static function.
// Use 'System::set_include_path(path)' to set a root include path.

## Note: You can use 'System::get_include_path()' to get current root
##       include path.

showl 'Current include path: ${System::get_include_path()}';    // Output: 'Current include path: ./'

// Now change the include path.
System::set_include_path('directory');

showl 'Include path after change: ${System::get_include_path()}';    // Output: 'Include path after change: directory/'

// Now include.

showl include('YetAnotherInclude');    // Output: 'Included with just the directory path!'
