// Wrapped dictionary is a Promit feature to wrap up identifier 
// into dictionaries.
// Pretty much shortcut of adding a variable to a dictionary
// with the same identifier name while constructing.

take name    = 'SD Asif Hossein',
     age     = 19,    // Well, I still am at the writing time.
     passion = 'Programming';

// Instead of doing something like
// { name : name, age : age, passion : passion } (which is boring)
// we can do this

showl { name(const), age, passion(const) };
